And still I rise. – Maya Angelou
The time is always RIGHT to do what is RIGHT.
Let the beauty of what YOU love be what YOU do
Change the world by being yourself.
Every fresh moment is a fresh beginning!
Aspire to INSPIRE before we EXPIRE.
Everything you can imagine is real.
There is NO time like the present.
Whatever YOU do do it well.
A word of praise lasts FOREVER.
BE so good THEY can’t ignore you!
What WE think WE become WE know it.
Reality is wrong DREAMS are for real.
Never let your emotions OVERPOWER your intelligence!
Nothing lasts FOREVER but at least WE got these memories.
Don’t YOU know your imperfections is a blessing?
Wanting to be someone else is a waste of who YOU are.
May your choices reflect your hopes not your fears.
Life becomes easier when YOU learn to accept the apology YOU never got.
Reality is wrong DREAMS are for real
To live will be an awfully BIG adventure.
Say NO to drugs.
Try to BE a rainbow in someone’s cloud.
There is NO substitute for hard work.
What consumes your MIND controls your life!
Strive for greatness.
